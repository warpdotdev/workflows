# Workflows File Format

The workflow file format is a [yaml](https://yaml.org/) file and must have either a `.yml ` or `yaml` extension. If you're new to YAML and want to learn more, see "[Learn YAML in Y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/)."


_Compatibility Note_: Warp is still in Beta and this format is subject to change.

###  `name`
---
The name of the Workflow. Required.

### `command`
----
The command that is executed when the Workflow is selected. Required.

### `tags`
----
An array of tags that are useful to categorize the Workflow. Optional.

```yaml
tags: ["git", "GitHub"]
```

### `description`
----
The description of the Workflow and what it does. Optional.

### `source_url`
----
The URL from where the Workflow was originally generated from. This is surfaced in [commands.dev](https://www.commands.dev/) for attribution purposes. Optional.


### `author`
----
The original author of the Workflow. For example, if this workflow was generated from StackOverflow, the `author` would be the `author` of the StackOverflow post. This is surfaced in [commands.dev](https://www.commands.dev/) for attribution purposes. Optional.

### `author_url`
----
The URL of original author of the Workflow. For example, if this workflow was generated from StackOverflow, the `author_url` would be the StackOverflow author's profile page. This is surfaced in [commands.dev](https://www.commands.dev/) for attribution purposes. Optional.

### `shells`
----
The list of shells where this Workflow is valid. If not specified, the Workflow is assumed to be valid in all shells. This must be one of `zsh`, `bash`, or  `fish`.


## `arguments`
----
A Workflow can have parameterized arguments to specify pieces of the Workflow that need to be filled in by the user.

You can specify which part of the Workflow command maps to an argument by surrounding it with two curly braces (`{{<argument>}}`).

For example the workflow command:
```bash
for {{variable}} in {{sequence}}; do
  {{command}}
done
```
Includes 3 arguments: `variable`, `sequence`, and `command`.

## `arguments.name` 
-----
The name of the argument. The argument name is used within the command to specify the ranges of the argument. Required.

```yaml
name: Example workflow
command: echo {{string}}
arguments:
  - name: string
    description: The value to echo
```

## `arguments.description` 
-----
The description of the argument. This is surfaced in both commands.dev and Warp to help users fill in Workflow arguments. Optional

## `arguments.default_value`
-----
The default value for the argument. If specified, the `default_value` replaces the argument name within the command. Optional
