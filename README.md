# Workflows

The repo for Workflows that appear within Warp and within [commands.dev](https://www.commands.dev/)

## What are Workflows?

Workflows are an easier way to execute and share commands within Warp. They are searchable by name, description, or command and are easily parameterized. See our documentation for more details: [https://docs.warp.dev/features/workflows](https://docs.warp.dev/features/workflows)

## How Do I Access Workflows?

Workflows can be accessed within Warp directly within the app, either through the Command Palette or by pressing `ctrl-shift-r`.

All public workflows (i.e. workflows within this repo) are also available at [commands.dev](https://www.commands.dev/).

## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome! If you have a workflow that would be useful to many Warp users, feel free to send a PR to add a Workflow spec.

The existing preset files should serve as an example for the format, while the a more comprehensive description of the file format is available in [FORMAT.md](FORMAT.md). Please request a review from someone on the Warp team once a PR is ready for review.
